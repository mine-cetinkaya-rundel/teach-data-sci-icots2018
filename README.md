Success in data science and statistics is dependent on the development of both 
analytical and computational skills. As statistics educators we are more familiar 
and comfortable with teaching the former, but the latter is becoming increasingly 
important. The goal of this workshop is to equip educators with concrete 
information on content and infrastructure for painlessly introducing modern 
computation into a data science and/or statistics curriculum. In addition to 
gaining technical knowledge, participants will engage in discussion around the 
decisions that go into choosing infrastructure and developing curriculum. Workshop 
attendees will work through several exercises from existing courses and get 
first-hand experience with using relevant tool-chains and techniques, including 
R/RStudio, literate programming with R Markdown, and collaboration, version 
control, and automated feedback with git/GitHub.

This is a two part workshop at [ICOTS 2018](https://icots.info/10/), presented by [Dr. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301) (Duke University + RStudio) 
and [Dr. Colin Rundel](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/) (Duke University).

This workshop is aimed at participants who are interested in the role of 
computing in either a Statistics or Data Science curriculum. This includes 
faculty who are designing new courses or programs as well as those who are 
interested in adding or improving a computational component to an existing course.

Part 1 will introduce teaching data science and statistics courses using R and 
RStudio and Part 2 will focus on best practices for configuring and deploying 
infrastructure to support these tools along with a version control system in 
the classroom.

Please bring your own laptop.

## Schedule

Both parts will take place in room 2-AVS (Level 2, AV Study Room) in Terrsa Hall.
